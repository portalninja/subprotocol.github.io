A beginning
===========

It had been a while since I last built a website, and I found myself itching, strangely so, to design something&mdash;*anyting*; I figured that it was a great chance to take a break from building server clusters, and fire up my long-time pal, good old Photoshop. What I created became the beginnings of this websites' design.

So here we are, I've finally found myself venturing into this whole blog thing. Content is sparse, paint is missing in corners, and it's still drying in other spots, but I'm mostly pleased with it thus far.


I think and breathe code, so [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/) was the obvious first choice to use as a CMS platform. Getting it setup was no trouble at all, and it's now happily running under [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com/). A bonus to using GitHub Pages is that this site is hosted essentially for free.

I spend all day in git, so using it to manage site content feels most natural to me. I can finally say that I do not miss Wordpress, sorry Automattic! Static CMS's like Jekyll are pushing forward by looking back.


I have no clue where this blog is going, or were it will take me. Hopefully any place but /dev/null.
